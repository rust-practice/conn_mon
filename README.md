## conn_mon - Connection Monitor Tool

Due to time constraints this project has been changed into a Proof of Concept (POC).
Long term plan is to start a new project that interfaces with [Trippy](https://github.com/fujiapple852/trippy) to accomplish the original goals of this project.
This is better because trippy is more feature rich and overall will result in a more robust and useful tool.

 A program to monitor the quality of a connection.
 
 NB: Only supports Linux right now.
